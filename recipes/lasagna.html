    <ol>
        <l1>Step 1:  Gather all your ingredients. </l1>
        <li>Step 2: Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a 
            Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. </li>
        <li>Step 3:Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, 
            for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. </li>
        <li>Step 4:Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
            Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. </li>   
        <li>Step 5: In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 
            tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. </li> 
        <li>Step 6: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).  </li>
        <li>Step 7: To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, 
            and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. </li>
        <li>Step 8: Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray 
            or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </li>
        <li>Step 9: Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. 
            Remove the foil and bake for an 
            additional 25 minutes.  </li>
        <li>Step 10: Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </li>
